# Analysis of Parser Iteration 1

## Environment

- Python: 3.13
- OS: linux

## Command

```bash
python3 /home/donguk/llm-lex-parse/llm_lex_parse/llm_parse/exp_gemini/parser_1.py /home/donguk/llm-lex-parse/llm_lex_parse/llm_parse/input.txt > /home/donguk/llm-lex-parse/llm_lex_parse/llm_parse/exp_gemini/output_1.txt 2>&1
```

## Output

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/donguk/llm-lex-parse/llm_lex_parse/llm_parse/exp_gemini/parser_1.py", line 9, in <module>
    from lexer import Token, tokenize
  File "/home/donguk/llm-lex-parse/llm_lex_parse/llm_parse/exp_gemini/lexer.py", line 150
    lexeme = " + source[position]
             ^
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 150); perhaps you escaped the end quote?

```

## Findings

The first iteration of the parser failed due to a syntax error in the `lexer.py` file. I had a lot of trouble with string escaping in Python. After fixing the lexer, the parser still failed, but this time with a parsing error. The error was `SyntaxError: Unexpected token int`. This was because the parsing table was incomplete.

## Follow-up Actions

- I will create `parser_2.py` with a more complete grammar and parsing table.
