# Parser Iteration 2 â€“ LALR(1) Parser

- **Command:** `python3 llm_parse/exp_codex/parser_2.py llm_parse/input.txt > llm_parse/exp_codex/output_2.txt 2>&1`
- **Result:** Implemented a full table-driven LALR(1) parser. The generated reductions exactly match `llm_parse/output.txt` (verified with `diff`).
- **Key Changes:** Constructed grammar definitions, computed FIRST sets, built canonical LR(1) states, merged to LALR, and resolved conflicts using precedence/associativity. Parser now imports the shared lexer from `exp_codex/lexer.py`, maps tokens to grammar terminals, and emits reduction logs in the required format.
- **Next Steps:** Promote `parser_2.py` to `llm_parse/exp_codex/parser.py` for downstream tooling, and consider extending pointer grammar in future iterations if multi-level pointers are required.
