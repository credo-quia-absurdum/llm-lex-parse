# Analysis of Parser Iteration 2

## Environment

- Python: 3.13
- OS: linux

## Command

```bash
python3 /home/donguk/llm-lex-parse/llm_lex_parse/llm_parse/exp_gemini/parser_2.py /home/donguk/llm-lex-parse/llm_lex_parse/llm_parse/input.txt > /home/donguk/llm-lex-parse/llm_lex_parse/llm_parse/exp_gemini/output_2.txt 2>&1
```

## Output

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token a in state 21
pointers->epsilon
func_decl->type_specifier pointers ID '(' ')'
pointers->epsilon
pointers->epsilon

```

## Findings

The parser failed with the error `SyntaxError: Unexpected token a in state 21`. This is because after parsing a `def`, the parser is in state 21 and it sees the token `a` which is an `ID`. The parsing table does not have an action for `ID` in state 21.

This is happening after the declarations:
`int a;`
`char b;`

The parser correctly parses these two definitions. After the second definition, it is in a state where it expects another definition or the start of a statement list. The next token is `a` from `a = 10;` which is an `ID` and the beginning of a statement.

My grammar is still incomplete. I need to add rules for statements.

## Follow-up Actions

- I will create `parser_3.py` with an updated grammar that includes statements.
