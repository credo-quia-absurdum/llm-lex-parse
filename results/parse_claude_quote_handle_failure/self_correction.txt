> How error is handled in the implemented parser? I've tested the parser with another code, but the output matches
only the beginning part of correct answer. Maybe there would be some corner cases that you did not handle? I cannot
 provide the another code here. But you have to review and fix the error in your code.

● I'll thoroughly review the parser implementation to identify potential corner cases and error handling issues.
  Let me analyze the code systematically.

● Read(parser.py)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines

● I found CRITICAL BUGS! Looking at line 330-334, the statement list detection has incorrect quoted tokens. Also,
  lines 473, 482 show similar issues. Let me identify all the problems:

  Critical Issues Found:

  1. Line 332-333: "'('", "\'-\'", "\'!\'", "\'&\'", "\'*\'", "\';\'" - These are WRONG! Should be "(", "-", "!",
  "&", "*", ";"
  2. Line 473: "\'-\'" should be "-"
  3. Line 482: "\'/\'", "\'%\'" should be "/", "%"
  4. Assignment parsing (line 418): Only checks for ID = but assignments can also be to array elements, struct
  members, pointer dereferences, etc. (e.g., a[0] = 5, p->x = 3, *ptr = 7)

  Let me create a comprehensive fix:
